1. The schema and view naming that will be used for all views will follow the convention determined below.
	a.        The naming convention for the schema will be [nmped_rpt]
	b.        The naming convention for the views will be the [vw_(Resource_Name)]
		i.        Example: For the Student Resource we would name it [vw_students] 
	c.        The full naming convention would look like the example below.
		i.        Example: For the Student Resource we would see it [nmped_rpt].[vw_students] 

2. Follow the below guidelines when using aliases for tables.
	a. Table aliases should be the the abbreviations of the table. See example below.
	b. All joined tables except the Descriptor table (see number 7) will follow the same alias convention
		i. Example: FROM [edfi].[Student] S WITH (NOLOCK)
			    INNER JOIN [edfi].[EducationOrganization] EO WITH (NOLOCK) on
	c. When table abbreviations are exactly the same use a identifiable piece of the table name to add to the end.
	d. StudentSchoolAssociation will always be SSA in all views.
		i. Example: FROM [edfi].[StudentSchoolAssociation] SSA WITH (NOLOCK)
		            INNER JOIN [edfi].[StudentSectionAssociation] SSA_Section WITH (NOLOCK)
	
3. The column names will remain the same as the original table. 
	a.        Only if there are two columns with the same name with joining tables will the name change. In this situation the column should take the name of the table_column_name. (Do not use the alias)
		i.        Example 1: StudentSchoolAssociation_EducationOrganizationId and EducationOrganization_EducationOrganizationId

4. When including tables in views please be sure to include the WITH (NOLOCK) clause. This is to prevent any possible locks from occurring on the database as there reports on the databases. 
	a.        Example: FROM [edfi].[Student] S WITH (NOLOCK)
                           INNER JOIN [edfi].[StudentSchoolAssociation] SSA WITH (NOLOCK) on
                            S.StudentUSI = SSA.StudentUSI

5. All views will be required to include the below columns. To easily identify the districts and school responsible. Make 4a the first fields of each view.
	a.        SELECT SUBSTRING(cast(SSA.SchoolId as varchar(10)),3,3) as 'DistrictCode', EO2.NameOfInstitution as 'DistrictName', 
                 SSA.SchoolId, EO.NameOfInstitution as 'SchoolName'

6. All views will be required to include the join below to determine ownership of the record. This is to ensure LEAs only see data for their District/Charter. 
	a.          --This join is to determine which LEA owns the student record (only inlcude for Student tbales Records)
                  INNER JOIN [edfi].[StudentSchoolAssociation] SSA WITH (NOLOCK) on (Table Alias).StudentUSI = SSA.StudentUSI
		    --This join is to determine which LEA owns the student record (only inlcude for Student tbales Records)
                  INNER JOIN [edfi].[StaffSchoolAssociation] SSA WITH (NOLOCK) on (Table Alias).StudentUSI = SSA.StudentUSI
                  --This join is to link the student to a specific school in the District/State Charter responsible
                  INNER JOIN [edfi].[EducationOrganization] EO WITH (NOLOCK) on
                  SSA.SchoolId = EO.EducationOrganizationId AND EO.Discriminator = 'edfi.School'
                  --This join is to link the student to a specific District/State Charter
                  INNER JOIN [edfi].[EducationOrganization] EO2 WITH (NOLOCK) on
                  SUBSTRING(cast(SSA.SchoolId as varchar(10)),3,3) = SUBSTRING(cast(EO2.EducationOrganizationId as varchar(10)),3,3) AND EO2.Discriminator = 'edfi.LocalEducationAgency'

7. Descriptor guidlines should be followed below when joining to descriptor id fields.
	a. Descriptors should always be LEFT JOIN to include all records and not one INNER JOIN records. See example below. 
	b. Descriptor aliases should be the the full descriptor name not including descritorid of the descriptor id being joined to. See example below.
		i. Example: LEFT JOIN [edfi].[Descriptor] BirthCountry WITH (NOLOCK) ON S.[BirthCountryDescriptorId] = BirthCountry.[DescriptorId]
		ii. Example: LEFT JOIN [edfi].[Descriptor] BirthSex WITH (NOLOCK) ON S.[BirthSexDescriptorId] = BirthSex.[DescriptorId]
	c. Be sure to always include CodeValue and Description from the descriptor table you are joining to. See example below.
	d. Be sure to always exclude ShortDescription from the descriptor table you are joining to. See example below.
		i. Example: BirthCountry.[CodeValue] as [BirthCountryCode],
			    BirthCountry.[Description] as [BirthCountryDescription],

8. Use the below template for the sql header for creation/changes
	a. You will update the information with your current information. Only when making changes would you add the Alt ID sections.	
/* © NMPED 2023
* 300 Don Gaspar Ave.
* Santa Fe, NM 87501
* Information Technology Division
* By: 'Creators Name' | 'Creators Title'
* Email: 'Creators Email'
* Date: 'Date Created'
* Desc: 'Description of the creation'
*
* Alt Id: 001 (Increment value each change)
* By: 'Updaters Name' | 'Creators Title'
* Email: 'Updaters Email'
* Date: 'Date Updated'
* Alt Desc: 'Description of the change'
*/
	
	b. When adding entire blocks (multiple lines/select/update statements) to the sql use the start/stop syntax below to keep track of what was added.
/* START BLOCK Alt Id: 001 * -------*/

/* END BLOCK Alt Id: 001 * -------*/
	
	c. When adding/deleting/updating individual lines use the below convention.
--Alt Id: 001

9. Subcollection in a resource should be its own view.
